FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
    Prompt engineering - The prototype seems to work okay with its current prompt, but maybe it could be even better.
    
    More policy data - A small selection of University policies can currently be queried, though not all of them.
    
    Search optimisation - LangChain generates a usable search query for semantic search based on the prompt, but using 
                          tools, it's possible to enhance it further to retrieve EXACT data.

    Tools - Currently, the LLM can use one tool (if it deems it necessary), which is to retrieve data from the DB.
            Perhaps more tools can be added for general use, like telling the time? (How long until this deadline, etc)

    MANUAL DATA CREATION:
        While the LLM can gather some general information about the university from the policies it retrieves, it 
        will be helpful (perhaps essential) to create an additional PDF of my own with some information about the university,
        such as the campus locations. This may also be the best way to encode data about societies?
