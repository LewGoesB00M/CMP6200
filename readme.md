This repository contains the LaTeX and Python sources for my final year dissertation project.

My project is as-yet unnamed, with a working title of "University Artificially Intelligent Chatbot".
This is the culmination of my extensive research into Large Language Models with a particular focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which was conducted alongside my other final year modules (all repositories with titles beginning "CMP6").

As time and development progresses, this README will be updated with further information.
