Wants to see evidence of general progress.
Updates of where you are right now, though he's contacting module leader for specifics.

Get a decent amount of your dissertation done. Best outcome is probably chapters 1 through 3 completed.

Title, abstract, intro, lit review, "actual work", evaluation with metrics, future improvements, conclusion.

actual work being
	Data needed
	Experiments done
	And more that I couldn't write quick enough	

Avoid repetition. Introduction must be concise, and refer to minimal literature.

Wants the implementation and results. He will not get the results but I can certainly do the implementation.
What literature was instrumental in getting to the implementation? Is he really suggesting a total rewrite of lit review?
It simply won't happen.

Intro is intro to the DOCUMENT, not the problem.
State problem to address, summary of how it was done, a couple references but not many. 

Lit review should have its own short intro. Probably just your theme identification.
End of lit review needs a summary paragraph, which there is. (Not sure if it's currently up to date with the latest additions?)

He used the word "presentation". 
He will specifically ask you about the roles you assign to your agents (plural).
Consider an evaluator agent and perhaps a chunk grading agent that tracks the relevance of the chunk to the question.
