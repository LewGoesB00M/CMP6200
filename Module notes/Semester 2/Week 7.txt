Focus on aspects that concern the research/work, expanding them in a way that also explains the concepts.
You're the expert on this specific project and not him, so the challenge is making it good for him to read as a layman.
Don't include unnecessary details but don't ignore important ones; find the balance.

Give "critical abilities" to the agent rather than more tools?
Agent should evaluate *itself*. Add multi agents with multiple "roles", perhaps grading answer depending on how X person would interpret the response (layman, student, expert)

Read up on how multi-agent systems are being used and how they improve "vanilla" LLM systems. Then perhaps offer a comparison showing qualitative difference (quantitative very good if possible).
