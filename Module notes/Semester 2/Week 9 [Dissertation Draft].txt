Many are struggling in the communication and organisation of ideas.
He's taking a strong focus on the literature review. 
He's not "squinting his eyes for tiny details", given that this is Draft 1.

General advice:
	When referencing via autocite, ensure that you do not put a full stop before the autocite.
	He specifically mentioned this in reference to another group member's work.
	
	Paragraph structure. Model it like your lit review. One topic to a paragraph.

	Don't scatter too much literature outside of the review itself. I don't believe that I did this?
	I cited websites, not papers, and they were few and far between.


Your lit review contains topics that have not directly influenced your work.
This is present in Agentic RAG, as well as mentions of neural networks in other sections.
Additionally, you mentioned XAI and HCAI. You didn't do either though.
(He mentioned this in reference to someone else's work and not yours.)
	

======================
DIRECT FEEDBACK:

Mention multi-agents. Last resort is manual implementation, create new node to pass generated response.
Bad idea but last resort.

With your objectives, mention hacking and guardrails to prevent jailbreaking.

Look into model quantisation in LLM review; it's a really popular topic right now.

He's insuinating that HCI shouldn't be in your literature review because you've not done anything with it.

You've talked about all your risks but not how you actually addressed them with contingency plans.

In the chatbot, maybe add an FAQ and/or suggested queries?
[Sounds very hard to implement.]

To fix the LaTeX quote mark bugs (he says ' isnt a quotation mark), you can use a package or the tilde key `? 
First I've heard of this, I assumed that ' doubled as a quotation mark, and LaTeX turns it into them?

Look into semantic answer similarity as an additional metric.
