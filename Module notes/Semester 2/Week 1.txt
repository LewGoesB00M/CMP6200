Perplexity and NotebookLM are quite good. Perplexity helps to find sources and then they can be added
to NotebookLM where you can directly query them. 
This is a thin tightrope to walk, however, as it is of course direct use of an LLM for academic purposes.

He wants you to evaluate multiple LLMs? Maybe it isn't quite as hard as you think to do that.

Your embedding model doesn't necessarily have to be OpenAI's. It's a critical decision that

the performance of the LLM.

		You should make a PowerPoint. Alternatively, just share your screen. 
		Therefore, Week 3's meeting must be conducted FROM YOUR PC, NOT YOUR LAPTOP IF POSSIBLE.
		Consider leaving the CMP6207 lab early if it's unlikely you could get home.

You should consider what this proof of concept entails. If possible, it sohuld have basic RAG.
At a bare minimum, make an interface for LLM prompting, though this would likely be poorly considered.
