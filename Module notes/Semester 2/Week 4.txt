Research Agentic AI as with last week.
Multiple instances of LLMs, each with an assigned role where they pass information between each other.
Creates a "cycle of refinement".

Says it allows you to do a comparative study.

You need some objective figures for how your app is doing.
An agentic workflow could help with this, documenting how it made you think differently and hard stats of performance improvements.
The more depth you go into, the more you could theoretically talk about if this project ever came up in a job interview.

Don't neglect your code for long periods of time - you will forget what does what.
