Atif meeting (Very brief due to circumstances this week):

Working with LLMs, working with databases, setting them up, etc
Query protection?

----------------
My fear of AI checking sounds plausible: keep your finger on the commit button CONSTANTLY for all your changes so that you've got the evidence log.

Islah Lecture:

Don't be railroaded into something you don't care about.
Islah isn't here week 3, but he has some other bloke covering who has also done dissertation lectures.
You're likely to recycle work done in your proposal into other documents throughout this year.
There are templates for every document you're expected to do this year. If they're word docs convert them to LaTeX.
Use the templates for the best odds; don't reinvent the wheel.
Your project has ONE aim, and probably 4 - 5 SMART objectives.
The aim is what you want to achieve, not how to do it - that's the objectives.
Aim is one sentence.
Things like "I will document XXX in a report" is not an objective; it's already implied by you doing this module.
He seems to be aware of how nobody does anything anymore and it's all chatGPT. 
In the specific part of SMART specify the audience. "Design an app that does..." "Design an app FOR STUDENTS that does..."
If you made a mobile app, it wouldn't need to be for both operating systems.
You need some kind of timeline tool i.e. Gantt chart. Make it all up, who actually cares?
Talk about three (?) past projects and how they screwed up and how you won't.
But also identify where they went right and how you'll follow that.
Literature search methodology - Google Scholar / BCU library?
If you reference a journal, maybe mention the journal itself and how good it is
IEEE Xplore is considered good.
