Different lecturer (Alistair something, leader of a music course)

Frame of the lit review is like a reverse Bloom's taxonomy, beginning broad to then 
becoming hyper-specific.

Sentence of what the topic is - History of how it has been used by companies etc,
then the specifics of your area.

At least eight references to a theme. (Remember that he isn't marking it, though. Atif is.)

Second marker (Iain) is likely to poke holes in your work.

I think you should add on to the LLM section, talking about how people can use APIs.

He mentions that everything in the library was a 2-1 or above. The library guy a few weeks

THE BRIEF ACTUALLY SAYS 1500, BUT THE UPLOAD IS 2000?
Inconsistency was mentioned in this class, perhaps contact Debashish Das (Module Lead)

Nobody even knows what the word count is.

Alistair mentioned interview transcription for referencing.

It sounds awfully like Dan in your class is doing your EXACT PROJECT.
NVM, he's doing the LGBT one off the list.

Google Forms aren't allowed due to GDPR, even though I've seen people use them.
Use Microsoft Forms instead.

You can (and maybe should) tweak your aims and objectives.
