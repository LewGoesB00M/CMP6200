Week 6's lecture has good information pertaining to citing sources.

Islah won't be delivering Week 8's lecture.
Your own words are still important, referencing things like the dictionary may make you look clueless.
You haven't been doing so but it is worth mentioning that you don't need to put accessed dates on published papers.
If you cite something at all, it is a REFERENCE, and doesn't go in the bibliography.
It's possible that ChatGPT / Gemini could actually get references for you, though they should be taken with a serious grain of salt.
MIT is a good source to cite, smart people there apparently.
Suummarising the work of others will make you better at your own work.
It's good to link two papers together.
If there's a really key idea, citing it with multiple papers would be smart to show others thought the same.

Directly quoting something is very poor practice. It doesn't show your understanding. 			      |
Only 10% of your document can be quotes.				      					      |
If you do, be certain to use quotation marks, and give the page number.   					      |
They should also apparently be indented if more than one sentence.	      					      |
The theory of XXX is "very interesting" (Author, 2024, p.32)		      					      |

In short, directly quoting should be avoided unless there's some reason you have to do it. It's always better to rephrase it.
Argues is a good word to use. "Author (2024) argues..."
Bib & references in alphabetical order.
Book references should have the publisher and the publisher's city, though you shouldn't use books unless very recent because they take ages to get published.
PhD theses, while valid sources, are somewhat looked down on.
In the references, a conference should start with "In: Proceedings of the..." in italics. I don't know if BibLaTeX is already doing that.
Know your audience - Atif is marking your work (and Iain, but less so?) so it's good to know what he doesn't like to see in work.
