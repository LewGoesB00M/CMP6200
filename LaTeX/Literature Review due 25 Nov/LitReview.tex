    \section{Aims and Objectives}

    \noindent
    This project aims to aid new and existing students alike while they are attending university with 
    helpful information about university itself, such as university societies, locations/campuses, 
    and policies through the medium of a digital chatbot companion to converse with.
    The project's objectives are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conduct a thorough literature review on the surrounding topics, namely AI, LLMs and NLP.
        \item Create effective documentation for all stages of development, highlighting challenges faced during the process.
        \item Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation alongside a cloud-based LLM to query a vector database of university-related data.
        \item Develop a chatbot capable of accurately answering user queries related to university 
        buildings, policies, and societies with a minimum 80\% accuracy rate.
        \item Evaluate the effectiveness of an AI assistant on university student acclimatization.
    \end{itemize}

    \pagebreak % REMOVE ME IF UNNECESSARY

    \section{Literature Search Methodology}

    \noindent 
    My literature search will be performed using multiple reputable databases for academic papers, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item IEEE Xplore
        \item Scopus / Elsevier
        \item Google Scholar
        \item arXiv
        \item BCU Online Library
    \end{itemize}
    
    \noindent By using multiple different databases to source my information from, I can ensure that
    any potentially relevant literature will be found. Figure \ref{fig:litSearch} depicts 
    how in a search for articles about employee retention, only 25.7\% appeared in multiple databases
    \autocite{litSearch}, meaning that the remaining 74.3\% of articles were exclusive to the single 
    database in which they were found, emphasising the importance of searching multiple databases.  

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{litSearchDBs.jpg}
        \caption{Distribution of searched articles across databases. \autocite{litSearch}}
        \label{fig:litSearch}
    \end{figure}

    \pagebreak 

    \noindent 
    All searches performed will have a heavy preference 
    to more recent literature, due to the constantly evolving fields my project is based on. 
    The search terms I will use to retrieve the data I will be studying are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Artificial Intelligence / AI 
        \item Natural Language Processing / NLP
        \item Large Language Models / LLMs
        \item Chatbots / Conversational Agents
        \item Retrieval-Augmented Generation / RAG
        \item User Experience / UX
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Human-Computer Interaction
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent
    By using these specific terms that are directly relevant to the core themes of my project,
    I will be ensuring that I only retrieve literature that will be of crucial use in its 
    development.


    \chapter{Literature Review}

    \section{Themes}

    To develop the artefact and conduct thorough background research on relevant literature to further my 
    knowledge of the subject areas, key general themes of the project were identified in Table \ref{tab:themes}. From these themes, further 
    keywords to be used in the literature search were derived to ensure that retrieved literature is directly relevant 
    to my research and development of the final artefact. Due to the constantly evolving fields the project focuses 
    on, it will be necessary to limit the results to primarily those written in recent years as there are 
    frequent new developments in the subject areas.

    \section{Review of Literature}

    \subsection{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}

    Researchers have always wanted to harness the processing power of computers to act in a manner 
    indistinguishable from that of humans from as long ago as 1950, where the question was posed 
    'Can machines think?' \autocite{turing_icomputing_1950}. Ever since, constant innovations were made in computer 
    intelligence and machine learning, from playing games of checkers at a better level than human players \autocite{samuel_studies_1959}
    to classifying the contents of millions of images using convolutional neural networks \autocite{krizhevsky_imagenet_2012}.

    Recently, AI is used across many disciplines for different purposes to complete tasks faster than, and in some cases better than,
    human workers, especially with the introduction of large language models (LLMs) \autocite{AIDigitalAssistants}. \textcite{wirtz_brave_2018} write that 'service robots'~\footnote{Defined as "system-based autonomous and adaptable interfaces that 
    interact, communicate and deliver service to an organization’s customers" \autocite[p.909]{wirtz_brave_2018}} can complete a variety of 
    tangible or intangible actions, such as two-way conversation with chatbots.
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{serviceBots.png}
        \caption{Service robots categorization by task-type and recipient of service \autocite{wirtz_brave_2018}.}
        \label{fig:serviceBots}
    \end{figure}

    When developing an AI project, it is important that the development process
    is ethical and human-centred, which is known as Human-Centred AI (HCAI). 
    Another issue is the "black-box problem" - the inability to know an AI's reasoning, meaning that 
    eXplainable AI (XAI) is a growing necessity \autocite{miro-nicolau_comprehensive_2025}. 
    
    Focusing on HCAI and XAI means the focus shifts from the machine to the user and their experience 
    using the AI. \textcite{AIEthics} strongly advocates for the 
    promotion of HCAI for the benefit of both companies and their users, which is a commonly accepted 
    idea due to the ethical risks of using AI. 
    
    Because AI calculates outcomes from its training data rather 
    than understanding social norms and perspectives, using it in sociotechnical systems poses serious risks 
    due to the 'traps' it can fall into, because it cannot account for every possibility such as the personal tendencies 
    and biases of its users \autocite{selbst_fairness_2019}, and therefore developers require a shift in focus - from the final product
    to the development process itself and end users, which also echoes Shneiderman's views. 

    \subsection{Natural language processing (NLP)}
    The ability for a computer to interpret and understand human language greatly enhances the scale of their capabilities. This was 
    recognised during the 1950s, where machine translation from Russian to English was demonstrated for the first time, albeit in a basic form \autocite{zampolli_natural_1994}.
    Ever since, NLP has been a key topic in computing, especially in recent years, with its applications widening 
    in scope with modern processing power.

    One of the key advancements in NLP is vectorisation, a process where data is embedded into a numerical equivalent that a computer can interpret, 
    enabling Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and the identification of semantic similarities between words through the use of an embedding model 
    like Word2Vec \autocite{mikolov_efficient_2013} without the need to manually label data. 
    Word2Vec was a key innovation in NLP, and Mikolov and Le went on to improve it further with Doc2Vec \autocite{le_distributed_2014}, which could embed 
    entire documents into semantically searchable vectorised forms.
    
    Embedding models have further improved since, most notably with \textcite{vaswani_attention_2017}'s Transformer architecture enhancing models such as 
    BERT \autocite{devlin_bert_2019}, which establishes context through analysing multiple neighbours of a word rather than reading from left to right,
    gaining a higher understanding of the text it processes. Many embedding models have since been developed, though one of the most reputable is OpenAI's 
    recent text-embeddings-3 model \autocite{openai_vector_nodate}, which can be used in the development of the chatbot at a low cost. 

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{basicVectorisation.png}
        \caption{A basic overview of vectorisation \autocite{openai_introducing_nodate}.}
        \label{fig:basicVectorisation}
    \end{figure}
    

    \pagebreak 

    \subsection{Large language models}
    LLMs are colossal machine learning models that leverage NLP to generate text, and have become widely used across 
    industries in place of technical support and human resources \autocite{vrontis_artificial_2022}. The training data required for an LLM is immense, 
    reaching 45 terabytes of text data for ChatGPT in 2023 \autocite{dwivedi_so_2023}. 
    
    This data is harvested from websites and social media due to them being the largest repositories of 
    opinionated text data (\textcite{dubey_llama_2024}, \textcite{wang_fine-grained_2016}). 
    However, meticulous care is taken into the specific sources used to remove 
    Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to minimise privacy and ethical concerns \autocite{dubey_llama_2024}.
    
    The previously mentioned Transformer by \textcite{vaswani_attention_2017} 
    became a staple in LLMs due to the major reduction in necessary processing power to produce higher-quality 
    results, and it continues to underpin many LLMs today, including ChatGPT \autocite{brown_language_2020}. 
    Even with these enhancements, LLMs are still extremely performance intensive,
    requiring more than 8 top-range server-grade GPUs to run some of the most powerful high-parameter models like LLaMA 3.1's 405 billion parameter model \autocite{dubey_llama_2024},
    and many therefore use cloud API solutions to access LLMs.
    
    The amount of parameters in a model does not entirely account for the quality of its responses, as studied by \textcite{ouyang_training_2022}
    in Figure \ref{fig:LLMPref} wherein their surveys revealed their fine-tuned LLM "InstructGPT" with over 100x less parameters than a 175 billion parameter 
    GPT3 model would often give answers preferred by its human assessors, which reveals that the fine-tuning and prompt engineering of an LLM is as vitally important
    to the quality of its responses as the amount of parameters.  
    
    % Another major innovation in LLMs came in the form of Retrieval-Augmented 
    % Generation (RAG), which allows LLMs to generate answers based on an additional external data source \autocite{lewis_retrieval-augmented_2021}, such as a company's own database.
    % RAG therefore allows pre-trained LLMs to be attached to another data source and generate text based on that source, which can help to reduce 
    % LLM "hallucinations" \autocite{lewis_retrieval-augmented_2021}, which are occurrences where the LLM will fabricate false information as though it were correct, 
    % due to the fact that it can retrieve the relevant information it otherwise may not have had.

    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.65\linewidth]{ouyangLLMPreference.png}
        \caption{Human evaluations of the GPT models produced by \textcite{ouyang_training_2022}. PPO and PPO-ptx are their models.}
        \label{fig:LLMPref}
    \end{figure}

    The simplest way to measure the accuracy and quality of an LLM's responses is through human evaluation surveys such as that conducted by \textcite{ouyang_training_2022}, though
    software approaches such as DeepEval can be used. DeepEval offers 14 metrics to test LLM outputs with \autocite{deepeval_introduction_2024},
    with a notable metric being "G-Eval", originally introduced by \textcite{liu_g-eval_2023}, which uses an "LLM-as-a-judge" approach where an LLM will evaluate
    and grade the quality of the output.


    \subsection{Retrieval-Augmented Generation}

    While LLMs are highly useful tools across many industries, they are not without limitations. The most notable 
    of these limitations are hallucinations \autocite{lewis_retrieval-augmented_2021}, where the LLM will fabricate 
    information that conflicts with user input, earlier conversation context or true facts \autocite{zhang_sirens_2023}. This occurs as a direct result of the LLM's parametric memory\footnote{Knowledge that the LLM has from its training data \autocite{siriwardhana_improving_2023}.}
    being overfitted or biased, which can be counteracted through introducing an external knowledge source, known as non-parametric memory (\textcite{komeili_internet-augmented_2022}, \textcite{siriwardhana_improving_2023}).
    
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{RAGProcess.png}
        \caption{A basic overview of a RAG workflow \autocite{openai_retrieval_nodate}.}
        \label{fig:RAGProcess}
    \end{figure}

    \textcite{siriwardhana_improving_2023} expanded upon the earlier works of \textcite{karpukhin_dense_2020} and \textcite{lewis_pre-training_2020} by creating 
    "RAG-end2end", which explored the capabilities of RAG on a dynamically updating knowledge store, meaning the LLM itself would not have to be retrained 
    every time the data updates, saving enormous amounts of processing power.
    
    RAG is dependent upon external knowledge stores such as vector databases, which store and process vectorised data
    for non-parametric memory \autocite{li_modernization_2023}, which makes them an essential part of the backend of 
    a RAG-enabled chatbot as studied by \textcite{odede_jaybot_2024}. 
    
    Many software options exist for
    vector databases, such as Milvus \autocite{wang_milvus_2021}, Pinecone \autocite{pinecone_pinecone_nodate} and Chroma \autocite{chroma_chroma_nodate}.
    \textcite{xie_brief_2023} compared these three, citing Pinecone's 'robust distributed computing capabilities and scalability', and its common usage 
    in real-time searching scenarios.
    
    Pinecone was also used in chatbots by \textcite{odede_jaybot_2024} and \textcite{singer_development_2024}, showcasing its potential as a vector database solution
    for chatbots.

    LangChain \autocite{langchain_introduction_nodate} is a popular open-source framework for RAG pipelines that can be used to connect backend elements 
    together, as described by \textcite{singer_development_2024} when they used it to chunk their text data and connect to their Pinecone vector database to store 
    the embedded data. 
    
    % Pinecone has a free option, though I'm not sure if this project could use it? Sounds like an Ethics Form problem.


    \subsection{Chatbots / Conversational Agents}

    Conversational agents, better known as chatbots, leverage NLP in order to simulate a conversational flow 
    between a user and machine, and have become mainstream products in recent years \autocite{liao_all_2018},
    though have existed as far back as 1966 with the creation of "ELIZA" for the IBM-7094 \autocite{weizenbaum_elizacomputer_1966}.
    As time has passed, advancements in chatbots have occurred in "waves", where each new wave has brought a major innovation \autocite{schobel_charting_2024}.

    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{ChatbotWaves.png}
        \caption{The five waves of conversational agent research \autocite{schobel_charting_2024}.}
        \label{fig:ChatbotWaves}
    \end{figure}

    Due to these considerable developments in the field, chatbots are now widely used 
    across industries such as education \autocite{kuhail_interacting_2023}. However, the use of the latest wave of chatbots based on LLMs,
    poses significant risks, especially in educational settings as studied by \textcite{neumann_llm-driven_2024},
    due to the risk of hallucinations being interpreted as absolute fact, although \textcite{shuster_retrieval_2021} 
    argued that this risk can be greatly reduced through introducing RAG to the backend LLM, which is further backed 
    by the RAG-based chatbot created by \textcite{ge_development_2023}, which they found to also give superior answers
    to those of a general-purpose chatbot without RAG.  


    Many platforms exist to aid chatbot development, though they are typically aimed at users from non-IT backgrounds 
    \autocite{srivastava_desirable_2020}. Popular platforms include IBM's watsonx Assistant \autocite{ibm_ibm_2024},
    Google's Dialogflow \autocite{google_conversational_nodate} and Microsoft's Bot Framework \autocite{microsoft_microsoft_nodate}.
    However, these are primarily targeted at enterprise clients which is reflected in their pricing. Instead of using these,
    the chatbot can be manually developed using LangChain as its framework.

    \pagebreak 

    \subsection{User experience and Human-Computer Interaction}

    The way people interact with their devices has drastically evolved over the years, from early MS-DOS command-line 
    interfaces (CLIs) to mouse-based graphical user interfaces (GUIs), to touch screens \autocite{kotian_systematic_2024}, greatly broadening
    the userbase of computers worldwide. Therefore, inclusive and accessible design is increasingly important to maximise the audience of any software,
    especially considering the growing disabled population \autocite{putnam_how_2012}. 
    
    As well as being inclusive, the design 
    should also be user-centred, meaning it should be an iterative process that is constantly taking user feedback 
    into account \autocite{chammas_closer_2015}. However, there are some barriers in this process when developing 
    chatbots, as studied by \textcite{clark_what_2019} in their survey of university students who stated that they view 
    chatbots as tools, and would not converse with them in the same way as they would a person, which would 
    limit their potential use and hinder the overall design process. 

    Users also often struggle to get chatbots to respond how they want, as their prompts may be poorly understood
    due to issues like overgeneralisation \autocite{zamfirescu-pereira_why_2023}, and studies show that they
    grow impatient after around 2 to 6 failed attempts, often branding the product as poor if this occurs \autocite{luger_like_2016}.

    \section{Summary}
    % I still think this is quite poor, but I don't know what else to say?

    In conclusion, this literature review has revealed multiple key focus areas for the chatbot's development. 
    The overall design of the chatbot must be iterative and human-centred, and user feedback should 
    be obtained at every possible opportunity to ensure the resultant product is high quality.
    
    A deep exploration into AI, specifically in its applications in NLP, LLMs and RAG, has revealed that the best approach 
    will be to leverage a pre-existing cloud-based LLM, such as GPT-4o-mini, via an API, as running an LLM on a local machine would 
    require an infeasible amount of processing power.

    The non-parametric memory accessed through RAG would be a vector database created with Pinecone storing embeddings generated by OpenAI's text-embeddings-3-small 
    model, and the overall framework will be LangChain. This will keep the cost of the project low while maintaining a tolerable level of quality in the bot's responses.
