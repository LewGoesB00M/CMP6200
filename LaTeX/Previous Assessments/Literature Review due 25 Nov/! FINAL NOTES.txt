Atif's feedback before meeting:
    Good overview regarding evolution and key concepts.
    Focus it more directly on your topic (LLM & RAG cloud-based chatbot)
    Review RAG pipelines and Vector Databases. (Will likely require removal of one theme.)
    Look into LLM testing frameworks as one of your objectives shot you in the foot (95% accuracy how?)
    Avoid long multi-topic paragraphs - Isn't that what the assignment literally is though?
    Objective 4 is outright incorrect. Objectives do not include "do it on time" because obviously.

TO BE ASKED IN MEETING:
    Improve paragraph structuring?
    To add two themes would require the removal of at least one if we are considering 2000 word count.
