  - ❌ Correctness (GEval) (score: 0.014242058400988957, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o, reason: The actual output provides no relevant information related to the expected output and lacks factual accuracy about award classifications., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What are the degree classifications?
  - actual output: I don't know. The retrieved context does not provide information about award classifications at Birmingham City University.
  - expected output: Achieving an average of 70% or above grants you first-class honours. 60-69% is an upper second (2:1), 50-59% is a lower second (2:2), 40-49% is third-class honours, and anything below 40% is a fail.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Correctness (GEval) (score: 0.8979871244423052, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o, reason: The actual output accurately states the pass mark for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. It provides extra details about compensation for marginal failure but doesn't contradict th
e expected output., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What is the pass mark for a module?
  - actual output: The pass mark for an undergraduate module is typically 40%, while for a postgraduate module, it is 50%. If you achieve a mark of 35-39% (UG) or 45-49% (PG) and meet certain criteria, you may be eligible for compensation for marginal failure.
  - expected output: For an undergraduate course, the pass mark is 40%. On a postgraduate course, it is instead 50%.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Correctness (GEval) (score: 0.7193601513219585, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o, reason: The actual output closely aligns with the expected output but lacks mention of symptoms of a harmful disease, a crime with substantial impact, and an accommodation crisis like eviction.
 It adds an unrelated exam emergency scenario which doesn't contradict but diverges slightly., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What circumstances will be accepted as extenuating circumstances?
  - actual output: Accepted extenuating circumstances include serious short-term illness or injury, worsening of an ongoing illness, death or significant illness of a close family member, unexpected caring responsibilities, and significant personal or family crises. Additionally, circumstances like witnessing a traumatic incident or an emergency that prevents you from attending an exam are also considered. However, it's important to provide appropriate evidence to support your claim. For more details, you can refer to the context provided.
  - expected output: Serious short-term illness or injury, worsening of an ongoing illness or disability, symptoms of a harmful infectious disease, death or significant illness of a close family member or friend, unexpected caring responsibilities, significant personal or family crises, witnessing or experiencing a traumatic incident, a crime which has had a substantial impact on you, an accommodation crisis such as eviction.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Correctness (GEval) (score: 0.6719725497181418, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o, reason: The actual output correctly describes that reassessment is only for failed components and that the grade is capped at the pass mark. However, it adds unnecessary details about the lack 
of limits on reassessments and the effect on progression, which could imply additional context not present in the expected output., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What happens if I fail a module?
  - actual output: If you fail a module, you may only be re-assessed in the failed assessment elements, as stated in the context: 'where a student fails a module, they may only be re-assessed in the failed assessment elements.' There are no limits on the number of modules or assessment components you can be reassessed in. If you pass the module after re-assessment, you will be awarded the module pass mark, but the overall mark will be capped at that pass mark. Additionally, failed modules do not contribute to the calculation of your overall mark required for progression or award classification.       
  - expected output: The first time you fail a module, you can be re-assessed for failed assessments, which is known as a resit. Your grade will be capped at the pass mark. You cannot be reassessed for assessments that you passed.

  - ✅ Correctness (GEval) (score: 0.7527104009137109, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o, reason: The actual output matches critical facts regarding enrolment requirements and timing. However, it omits the option for a 'Break in Study' present in the expected output and replaces 'st
udents' with 'you', making it less general., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: When must I enrol?
  - actual output: You must enrol at the start of your programme and for each level by the Friday of week four from the start date of your course.
  - expected output: Students must enrol at the start of their programme and enrol for each level by the by the Friday of week four from the start date of their course unless a Break in Study has been approved.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Correctness (GEval) (score: 0.797498847580945, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o, reason: The key fact of a 10% reduction for a 3-day late submission matches. Additional conditions such as exemptions for marks below a certain threshold and a final deadline do not contradict b
ut add context, which is plausible and does not disrupt specific expected content., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What happens if I submit my assignment 3 days late?
  - actual output: If you submit your assignment 3 days (between 24 hours and one week) late, your original mark will be reduced by 10%. For example, if your original mark was 60%, it would be reduced to 54%. However, this reduction will not apply if your original mark is below 40% (or 50% for postgraduate courses) or if the deduction would lower your mark from a pass to a fail. Remember, work will not be accepted more than one week after the original deadline, resulting in a mark of 0.
  - expected output: If an assignment is submitted 3 days late, your mark will be reduced by 10%.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Correctness (GEval) (score: 0.15358772699883386, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o, reason: The actual output states that a 3-minute late submission is penalized with a 5% mark reduction, contrary to the expected output that it is not considered late., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What happens if I submit my assignment 3 minutes late?
  - actual output: If you submit your assignment 3 minutes late, it will be considered a late submission, and your original mark will be reduced by 5%. For example, if your original mark was 60%, it would be reduced to 57%. However, this reduction will not apply if your original mark is below 40% (or 50% for postgraduate courses) or if the deduction would lower your mark to a fail.
  - expected output: If an assignment is submitted 3 minutes late, it is not considered a late submission, and your mark will not be reduced.

All factual elements about 
affecting academic performance and assessment issues are present., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What is an EC claim?
  - actual output: An EC claim, or extenuating circumstances claim, is a request made by students at Birmingham City University for consideration of circumstances that may have affected their academic performance. This can include reasons such as late submission of assessments, impaired performance during assessments, or absence from in-person assessments. The claim process allows students to seek support and potentially receive extensions or other accommodations based on their circumstances.
