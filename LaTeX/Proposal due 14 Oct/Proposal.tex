    \chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
    \section{Background and Rationale}
    With artificial intelligence (AI) becoming increasingly more powerful and useful in 
    recent years, in some cases even surpassing humans in areas like language and image 
    recognition~\autocite{owid-artificial-intelligence}. It is therefore essential that 
    higher education institutions take advantage of it and ensure to keep up-to-date with its
    developments in the interest of academic integrity, which was also stated in the 
    Higher Education Policy Report dated 28 March 2024 - "Higher education will have to adopt,
    adapt, collaborate and lead to take advantage of AI while managing the risks"~\autocite{AIUni}.\\
    
    \noindent This project aims to leverage recent technical developments in natural language processing (NLP)
    to create a digital assistant for university life that students can use to gain information on topics
    such as university policies and locations on campus. This is because attending university for the first time
    is a daunting and stressful experience for many, often due to it being a new and unfamiliar environment 
    where students have full independence unlike their previous educational settings, which could possibly 
    lead to declines in academic performance and social activity. Some students may not 
    wish to speak with newer people who they don't know about university topics for fear of 
    ridicule or embarrassment, and would benefit from a digital companion to help them to become 
    acquainted with their new environment without the perceived risk of social judgement.\\

    \noindent Chatbots are also a significant tool across the tech sphere, with 73\% of surveyed web users expecting
    companies to have chatbots for convenient interactions \autocite{chatbotStats}. By giving students a 
    quick and easy tool to get the information they need, they can instead shift their focus to their studies
    instead of being distracted by smaller issues.

    

    \section{Key Themes/Topics}
    This project undertakes the following key themes:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item As the backbone of this project, extensive research into this topic will be necessary 
                to ensure users have a smooth experience.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Embedding models
            \begin{itemize}
                \item To store non-numeric data such as university policies, a suitable embedding model
                will be necessary to vectorise said data into a numerical representation interpretable by
                the machine learning model.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \chapter{Aims and Objectives}
    \section{Project Aim}
    This project aims to aid new and existing students alike while they are attending university with 
    helpful information about the university itself, such as university societies, locations/campuses, 
    and policies through the medium of a digital chatbot companion.

    \section{Project Objectives}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \large \textbf{WIP.}
    \end{itemize}


    \chapter{Project Planning}
    \section{Initial Project Plan}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Research
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Conduct heavy research into machine learning and natural language processing to bolster my 
            knowledge of the topics to assist in the development of the chatbot.
            \item Identify similar projects that already exist to understand where challenges may arise in 
            development and how to differentiate my work to make it stand out and provide unique value.
        \end{enumerate}

        \item Data collection
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item To present users with information from the university, I must first collect this information
            for myself from sources such as the university website and the Student Union.
        \end{enumerate}

        \item \large \textbf{Section WIP.}
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Resources}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An integrated development environment (IDE) for Python
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Visual Studio Code is a lightweight editor that supports most programming languages,
            including Python.
            \item An alternative could be JetBrains' PyCharm Professional, which I can access at no charge due
            to being a student.
        \end{itemize}

        \item Machine learning libraries \& frameworks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Examples include PyTorch, TensorFlow and SpaCy.
        \end{itemize}

        \item A powerful computer.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Training machine learning models requires significant processing power and RAM. I own a decently 
            powerful computer with a higher-end graphics card which should be able to handle a project of
            this scale.
        \end{itemize}

        \item A platform for the chatbot.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Many messaging services allow developers to add bots, such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp or
            Discord.
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

            The devices used to write code and documentation could encounter hard drive corruption, potentially 
            losing considerable amounts of work. & 2 & 5 & Medium & Ensure that all work is regularly backed up to 
            the cloud and/or a secondary device. Github will be used as a version control system for the project 
            to keep an audit trail of all changes.\\
           
            \hline

            Time constraints could potentially cause rushed and poor-quality work if development is not to a 
            consistent and regular schedule balanced with other university modules. & 3 & 4 & Medium-High &
            Ensure that work is completed at regular intervals, even if the amount at each interval is small. 
            In doing so, it will be much easier to balance three simultaneous deadlines. \\

            \hline

            Personal circumstances could cause progress to slow or halt if something unexpected were to occur
            during the year. & 3 & 4 & Medium-High & Try to be ahead of deadlines where possible to ensure that
            there is free time that could be used in the event of a sudden break becoming necessary.\\
            
            \hline

            Budget constraints could be an issue during development. & 2 & 2 & Low & Use open-source or lower
            cost resources during development, and create a budget to adhere to. \\

    \chapter{Project Review and Methodology}
    \section{Critique of Past Similar Projects}
    While researching similar projects, I identified three useful final year projects by BCU students. The first
    was a 2019 project by Sanah Mehreen Hussain, which was the creation of a chatbot to assist students with their
    module content. As another chatbot project, the processes they undertook in their development will be heavily
    interlinked with my own, which made it imperative to review. Their report was highly detailed, providing 
    a clear and strong explanation of each step of their development process. They had created many diagrams
    to clearly explain their processes, making it a powerful learning resource. Their chatbot was placed 
    within Moodle itself, which is used by BCU students to access all of their work, which would massively improve
    its engagement. Sanah also conducted surveys for user feedback which proved useful in their evaluation.\\
    
    \noindent Another useful project to review was Ali Akbar Rashid's 2022 chatbot for BCU IT support. This was another 
    highly detailed exploration of the chatbot development process. Ali used the Agile project management 
    methodology in the development of their project, citing its fast approach and lower cost in relation
    to other methodologies such as Waterfall, as well as frequent opportunities for feedback. Even still,
    Ali mentioned time limitations due to the balancing of his project with his other university modules, which
    suggests that I must take particular care to ensure I am setting and meeting frequent goals as mentioned in 
    Section~\ref{sec:risks}. Ali's evaluation and research was also heavily detailed, with a strictly defined 
    methodology for both.\\

    \noindent The third useful project was "KURA", a chatbot to assist users with information about the 2022 World
    Cup, developed in 2023 by Stanley Eweniwe Osuozah. While it is not as directly linked to a university chatbot 
    like the others, it is functionally similar in that it is also retrieving information and displaying it to users,
    though simply of a different topic. This project was not documented quite as well as the other
    two, though it did still have some useful information to be learned. Their user survey was somewhat confusing to 
    interpret, with statements with different implications such as "the KURA chatbot is welcoming" followed immediately
    by "the KURA chatbot is not clear about what it is meant for." This shift from a positive statement to a negative one
    within the survey could confuse participants and give potentially misleading results due to their misinterpretation
    of what they are being asked. The dataset they published to Kaggle was also very limited, and did not yield
    much useful information. From this project in particular, I have gathered that I must convey my intentions 
    clearly and in significant detail to ensure that my work could be used by others in future to assist the 
    development of their own projects.
    
    \section{Literature Search Methodology}
    There will be a considerable amount of research required to develop this project to a good standard; therefore,
    I will make use of online resources such as but not limited to the BCU library portal, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier
    and Google Scholar to find high-quality documents to base my project upon. To do so, I will need to use 
    curated search terms to yield the specific information that I will need. Therefore,
    I will use the following terms:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Artificial intelligence
        \item Natural Language Processing
        \item Chatbots 
        \item Machine learning
        \item Deep learning
        \item Ethical AI
        \item Information retrieval
        \item User experience
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent My search will also be limited to papers from at least 2020, as AI and NLP are cutting-edge fields changing
    constantly, and information beyond that point is almost certain to no longer be relevant.

    \section{Initial Literature Search Results}
    In my initial search of these topics, I identified the following papers that I believe will be instrumental
    in the development of this project.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \fullcite{LAURIOLA2022443} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This article from the Neurocomputing journal, a peer-reviewed journal covering AI, machine learning
            and neural networks with an impact factor of 6.0, gives a wide range of knowledge on NLP and the processes
            surrounding it such as one-hot encoding and vectorisation, which will be essential for me when 
            supplying my chatbot with university related information. It shows detailed diagrams and explanations of
            the aforementioned processes as well as explaining the software that can be used, such as Python's 
            SpaCy library.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \fullcite{ChatbotTechConference}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This conference paper elaborates on what a chatbot precisely is as well as their applications. It
            also elaborates on their history and advancements made through time. More importantly, it discusses the
            architecture of a chatbot as well as key terms such as entities and contexts, and the design and 
            development processes of chatbots, which will be absolutely integral to my project.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \fullcite{DU2021961}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This article from the Journal of Business Research, a journal with an impact rating of 10.5,
            describes the ethical implications of AI, which will be an important topic in relation to my project
            due to the fact that my chatbot will be interacting with students. Additionally, this article,
            due to being part of a business journal, refers to the widespread application of AI in large businesses
            such as Amazon and Netflix, and furthermore, the growth of digital personal assistants such as Amazon's
            Alexa and Apple's Siri. 
        \end{itemize}

        \item \fullcite{ChatbotUX}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This article from the Journal of Broadcasting \& Electronic Media will be extremely useful to 
            the development of this project due to the heavy links between them. It describes the gratifications
            users seek from their interactions with chatbots, which I must take into consideration during the 
            development of my own to ensure it is what my users expect it to be, and provides a smooth, gratifying
            and simple user experience.
        \end{itemize}
