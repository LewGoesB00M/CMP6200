\begin{abstract}
    Artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) are
    rapidly developing technologies, seeing constant advancements at a frequent basis.
    This project aims to leverage these new advancements, specifically in LLMs, to create a digital assistant 
    to help new students of Birmingham City University get acquainted to their new environment. This is accomplished 
    through the development of a chatbot web application which uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with 
    OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini LLM on an embedded vector database of university information. The development process 
    is thoroughly explored, with key elements of the chatbot's code being discussed in detail.
    The produced chatbot performs well, achieving 80\% answer correctness on a dataset of testing questions
    evaluated using DeepEval's GEval metric with a gpt-4o LLM and manual verification.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}
I would like to primarily acknowledge my project supervisor, Dr. Atif Azad, as having a major positive 
influence throughout the development of this project. His expertise and advice had a significant 
effect throughout the entire project's development and report writing, and both would be of substantially 
lower quality were it not for his guidance.

\para Additionally, I would like to acknowledge my father, who continually motivated me to produce high-quality 
work throughout a deeply challenging year. Without the support of both of these people, this project 
would not have been feasible, and for this I thank them both greatly.

        \hline 

        AI & A field of computing dedicated to allowing computers to simulate human
        learning by training them on large amounts of data so that they can recognise patterns to classify or 
        predict unknown data. AI can only be as good as the data it is trained upon ("Garbage in, garbage out"), and could
        become biased if it is fed too much data of a certain type.\\

        % \hline

        % Generative AI & AI dedicated to the generation of content rather than prediction or 
        % classification. It is possible for generative AI to produce text, images and 
        % more recently, even video and sound. & LLMs, Tokens, Embedding \\

        \hline

        Natural Language Processing \newline (NLP) & NLP refers to the use of machine learning to encode and 
        process text to understand it similarly to humans, which can be used to allow direct 
        two-way conversation between users and computers.\\

        \hline
        
        LLMs & Large Language Models are a type of machine learning model dedicated to the recognition and generation of text.
        As suggested by their name, they are trained on enormous amounts of text data, which allows them 
        to have active conversations with users. There are many different LLMs, and as their size and 
        complexity increases, so too does the necessary processing power. 
        \\
        \hline 

        Retrieval-Augmented Generation \newline (RAG) & The optimisation of the generated text output of an LLM, incorporating
        an external data source to enhance its contextual knowledge and the subject relevancy of its outputs. \\

        \hline
        Chatbot \newline Conversational Agent & Software that simulates a natural conversation between the 
        computer and end user. Many chatbots, including the one to be produced in this project, utilise recent
        developments such as Generative AI and natural language processing (NLP) to interpret and respond to user queries.

        % User Experience (UX) & The end user's overall experience of using a system, such as its ease of use and 
        % whether it is enjoyable to use. In the context of this project, it will refer to the user's 
        % ability to smoothly converse with the chatbot and how human-like it is.
