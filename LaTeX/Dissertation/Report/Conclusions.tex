In conclusion, this report has thoroughly detailed the design and development process of a chatbot aimed to assist new university students 
to become acclimated to their new surroundings through an interactive conversational medium to learn key information about the university 
such as its governing policies.

\para A thorough literature review on surrounding topics and the current state-of-the-art was conducted to allow for the chatbot's development
and documentation of the development process and final product. The final product itself performed to a suitable degree, answering 80\% of its 
evaluation golden dataset questions correctly in relation to its expected answers, though improvements could have been made to increase this 
percentage.

\para The final product performs well, meeting and in some cases exceeding its stated functional requirements, though was not 
able to meet all of its non-functional requirements. Despite these shortcomings, the chatbot is functional and a very viable source of BCU-related 
information using natural language prompts for specific information rather than having to manually consult long policies and web searches.
