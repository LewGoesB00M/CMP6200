\section{Aims and Objectives}\label{sec:AimsAndObjectives}
This project aims to aid new and existing students alike while they are attending university with 
helpful information about university itself, such as university societies, locations/campuses, 
and policies through the medium of a digital chatbot companion to converse with.
The project's objectives are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Conduct a thorough literature review on the surrounding topics, namely AI, LLMs and NLP.
    \item Create effective documentation for all stages of development, highlighting challenges faced during the process.
    \item Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation alongside a cloud-based LLM to query a vector database of university-related data.
    \item Develop a chatbot capable of accurately answering user queries related to university 
    buildings, policies, and societies with a minimum 80\% accuracy rate.
    \item Evaluate the effectiveness of an AI assistant on university student acclimatization.
\end{itemize}
